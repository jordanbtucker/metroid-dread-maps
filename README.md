# Metroid Dread Maps

These maps are based on https://github.com/ih8ih8sn0w/Metroid-Dread-Maps,
however each item is cataloged with a unique ID for referencing in 100% runs.

Each item ID follows the format `<area><type><number>` where `<area>` is the
first letter of the area where the item exists, `<type>` is the type of item,
and `<number>` is the sequential number unqiue to the item of its type in its
area.

For example, `AM1` means the first Missile Tank in Artaria. `CEP2` means the
second Energy Part in Cataris.
